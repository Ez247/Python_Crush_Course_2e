"""_Numbers_: Used to keep score in games, represent data in visualization, store info in 
              web apps and so on. 
            1. Python treats numbers in several different ways:
                a. Integers ~ whole numbers 10, 1000, 5657, - 90 etc
                b. Floats ~ numbers with a decimal point 10.0, 1.0, 676.5, 49.99 etc
            2. You can add(+), subtract(-), multiply(*), and divide(/)

print(div) 

#Underscores in Numbers ~ makes large numbers readable

#Multiple Assignment ~ Assigns values to more than one variable.
